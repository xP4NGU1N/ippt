# Form tracker for IPPT Stations

Created this programme to prepare for IPPT (push-up and sit-up stations), and to experiment with OpenCV/ Mediapipe.<br />Included libraries to be installed in the notebook.

Push-up: Tracks arm angle (pivot at elbow) and back angle (pivot at hip) to determine form.<br />Sit-up: Tracks shoulder to ankle angle (pivot at hip) to determine form.
